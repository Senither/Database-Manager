Query Builder:
  The followin methods should be created and added under the "Ordering, Grouping, Limit, & Offset" in the wiki, 
  information about the methods can be found here: https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/queries#ordering-grouping-limit-and-offset
    ☐ having
    ☐ havingRaw

  ☐ Create a Conditional Statements when method, allowing the user to parse it their own logic for a when statement.
    Information can be found here https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/queries#conditional-statements
      ☐ Create a *QueryWhenStatement* interface the when method should have as a parmater, with one method for handeling the logic.

  ☐ Create a *QueryWhereStatement* interface that allows users to parse is logic to create an advanced where statement.
    Information can be found here https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/queries#advanced-where-clauses

  ✔ Change the **insert** and **update** methods to carry out the action instead of the **queryUpdate()** and **queryInsert** methods. @done (06/07/16 16:08)
  
  ✔ Fix the building process of where statements so the operator is built in front of the statement, not behind it. @done (15/07/16 01:38)
    Currently calling code like
      builder.where("id", 1).orWhere("id", "<" 5);
    Would produce the following code
      SELECT ... FROM `tableName` WHERE `id` = 1 AND `id` < 5;
    This is due to the first where clause produces an AND operator, but the OR operator should be used in this case. 

Grammar:
  ✔ Fix SQL support for creating tables @done (08/07/16 17:39)
    SQLite doesn't support ENGINEs and CHARSETs

Schematics(Schema):
  ☐ Add a *updateTable* method which will function the same way as the *createTable* method, however it will just update a existing table instead of making a new one.
    ☐ An *AlterGrammar* grammar class should be created in order to format update table information.
  
  ☐ addd a **createUser** method that will create a user with a set of permissions
    ☐ create a **permissionNode** method that should contain all the permissions that the user will end up with
    ☐ if no **permissionNode** object is parsed, by default the user account should have full access to all databases called 'username_'

  ☐ add a **createDatabase** method that will create a new database
  ☐ Implement a way to add a default character set for a given table or column field.

  ☐ Add a way to parse in the full package path for a eqloquent model to a clause(where, join, etc...), and the clause will then determine what table name to use from the model. 

Seeder:
  Faker seeder logic, from PHP

Plugin:
  ✔ Add Bungee support @done (06/07/16 13:42)
    ✔ Add the same commands as on the Bukkit side, just re-name them to /bungee<command> <etc...> @done (06/07/16 13:43)

  Commands:
    ☐ Finish the **edit command**

  Version fetch:
    ☐ Add a version comparitor so the version fetch can tell users how many versions they're behind.
      For this to work all the public versions of DBM must be stored in the version file.

Wiki:
