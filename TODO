Database Manager:
  ✔ Add a *queryUpdate* method that access the custom connection name value. @done (12/06/16 17:00)

  ✔ Add a *queryInsert* method that allows user to do the same as *queryUpdate*, but instead it will return a Set<Integer> object, where each index reprecent a ID value of the row that was inserted. @done (12/06/16 17:08)
    ✔ Checks should be made to make sure the parsed query is actually a INSERT query, if that's not the case a *DatabaseException* should be thrown. @done (12/06/16 17:08)

  ☐ Implement a **setPrefix** method, either in the DBM main class or the options(The options might be a better choice)
    ☐ Make sure any time a table name is created, that the prefix is added infront of the table name dynamicly.

Database Factory:
  ✔ Add a *PluginContainer* class where all plugin info should be stored for any plugin that has created an instance of DBM. @done (12/06/16 17:43)
    ✔ If a plugin requests to create a new DBM instance, but a PluginContainer instance was already found, return the existing instance instead. @done (12/06/16 17:43)
    ✔ Create a dynamic lookup on the main instance of the plugin description, allowing us to create a dynamic search that would allow us to remove the DBM instance from Eloquent and the Query Builder, making the database connection random. @done (12/06/16 23:37)

Query Builder:
  The followin methods should be created and added under the "Ordering, Grouping, Limit, & Offset" in the wiki, 
  information about the methods can be found here: https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/queries#ordering-grouping-limit-and-offset
    ✔ inRandomOrder @done (12/06/16 16:34)

    ☐ havingRaw
    ✔ skip  @done (12/06/16 16:51)
    ✔ take @done (12/06/16 16:51)

  ☐ Create a Conditional Statements when method, allowing the user to parse it their own logic for a when statement.
    Information can be found here https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/queries#conditional-statements
      ☐ Create a *QueryWhenStatement* interface the when method should have as a parmater, with one method for handeling the logic.

  ☐ Create a *QueryWhereStatement* interface that allows users to parse is logic to create an advanced where statement.
    Information can be found here https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/queries#advanced-where-clauses

  ✔ Fixed an issue where **where clause** **or** and **and** statements would repeat twice.  @done (16/06/16 13:14)

Schematics(Schema):
  ✔ Fix the *defautValue* on the field class for booleans, parsing in a raw boolean seems to throw exceptions, so a SQL Action object should be used instead. @done (12/06/16 16:06)

  ☐ Add a *updateTable* method which will function the same way as the *createTable* method, however it will just update a existing table instead of making a new one.
    ☐ An *AlterGrammar* grammar class should be created in order to format update table information.
  
  ☐ addd a **createUser** method that will create a user with a set of permissions
    ☐ create a **permissionNode** method that should contain all the permissions that the user will end up with
    ☐ if no **permissionNode** object is parsed, by default the user account should have full access to all databases called 'username_'

  ☐ add a **createDatabase** method that will create a new database
  ☐ Implement a way to add a default character set for a given table or column field.

Migration:
  ☐ Add a **Migration** class and create a getter for it in the DBM main class.
    ☐ Add a **up** method that should be used to roll all the non-migrated migrations to the database.
    ☐ Add a **down** method that should be used to roll all the migrated migrations away from the database.
    ☐ Add a **register** method that should register one or multiple migrations at a time. 
    ☐ Add a **rollback** method that functions the same way as down, but takes in an integer argument for how many migrations should be rolled back. 

  ☐ Add a Migration contract that all migrations should abid by
    The contract should have an **up** and **down** method, both needs to take the Schema class as an argument.

Seeder:
  Faker seeder logic, from PHP

Collection:
  ✔ Fix the DatabaseException thrown in the *getStrings* method so it just returns NULL if nothing is found with the provided key. @done (13/06/16 15:53)
      This was fixed by removing them compeltely since the methods wasen't actually needed anyway.

  ✔ Create a way to make a new *Collection* instance without having to parse in a ResultSet, for example having the keys as the first paramater, and the items as the second. @done (13/06/16 15:53)

  ✔ Implement more *Collection* methods, allowing users to do more things with the collection method itself. @done (13/06/16 15:53)
    Information for all of the methods can be found here: https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/collections#available-methods
    Note that some of the methods might not actually be usless in a Java case, so some might have to be removed.
